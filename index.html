        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Founded to expand access to diplomacy and global politics, the Sacramento Valley Model United Nations organization serves as a local way for students in the region to engage in cost-effective, local competitive dialogue. Entirely student-led and supported by the volunteers of college/university Model UN club members, we provide opportunities for youth to engage in global affairs, strengthen their skills in public speaking, and grow into thoughtful, informed leaders.</p>

Through this, we host conferences locally at high school gymnasiums and event halls under the supervision of college and university level Model UN communities, bringing a valuable experience to all interested. Information on upcoming conferences can be seen on our events page!</p>
